Projects
Project 1: Formula 1 Timings Board
This program analyzes lap time data from Formula 1 practice sessions. It processes a file to display the Grand Prix location, the driver with the fastest lap, each driver's best and average times, and the overall average time. It also sorts lap times in descending order and includes additional driver details like names and teams.

Project 2: University Chatbot Prototype
This chatbot simulates a conversation with prospective university students. It greets users by name, detects keywords in their questions to provide relevant responses, and exits when prompted. Additional features include configurable responses using external files, logging the chat session, and simulating random chat disconnections.
